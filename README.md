This project is a simple ultrasonic radar system built using Arduino, an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, and a servo motor. The sensor rotates from 0° to 180°, detecting objects by measuring the distance using ultrasonic waves. The distance data is sent to a connected system, where it can be visualized in a radar-style interface using Processing or serial monitor. This setup mimics a basic radar's scanning functionality and is useful for understanding object detection concepts. It serves as a great beginner project for learning about sensors, motor control, and real-time data visualization.
